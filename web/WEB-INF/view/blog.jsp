                <p>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his
                    castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so
                    flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.
                    Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works,
                    producing visible outputs separately from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures,
                    produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the
                    correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never
                    were nor could be."</p>

                    <p>This is one of my favourite description which regards programming.
                        It is a little metaphorical and poetic, but it's beautiful because computer programming is
                        considered to be an art
                        like writing poetry. A masterpiece is based on imagination and imagination has no limits. We can
                        build things
                        that can change the world we live in, if we put our imagination in practice along with our
                        programming skills.</p>
                    <p>'Coding' a cooler word for programming is what I love the most, because it's an art, it's a
                        reflection
                        of our creative thoughts and even if sometimes looks messy, It's still beautiful :)</p>

                <p>It's something different here, it seems like I live in another world where people are really enjoying
                    life in every possible way. It's not just the island that makes the magic. It's their modesty and
                    generosity which fulfills eachother hearts everyday with kindness and emphathy.</p>

                    <p>They seem like not having any worries at all , without overthinking abut their
                        future, leting
                        themselves carried away by the waves of destiny.Nobody could really experience how it would be
                        to
                        live like them, until they let go their desire for material prosperity, their selfishness and
                        most
                        of all their greed for climbing the social ladder.
                    <p>Here, everybody is equal no matter what they are
                        working at , because keeping the discrimination apart is a natural thing to do. The fact is that
                        peace and quietness are the main priorities to mentain in this small comunity.In order to feel
                        like
                        living the life of a cititzen from Thassos, one has to let his soul enchanted by the sound of
                        the
                        sea , becoming just a contemplator of the beauty of life without trying to interferee or corrupt
                        the
                        laws of nature.</p>
                    <p>We should live like there is nothing more important than peace of mind , quietness
                        and having the family close. Mostly, young people would argue that because they are too
                        impacient
                        and full of rush to live a life that quiet.And this may be true but everyone percieves
                        differently
                        this way of living but for me it is ideal when I will got old.</p>
                    <p>Until then , I will swim through life
                        tirelessly and then let myself carried away, by the waves to the endless blue horizont.ï»¿</p>
